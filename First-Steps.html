<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unzip the downloaded files in any folder you like. If you want to, insert the files from the SampleDB folder, so you can get a feeling of the software right away</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="first-startup">First Startup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Windows warns you from running the application, as it has no certificate. If you do not trust the exe file I supply, you can build the program on your own. Just download the soure code for that purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="working-with-the-software">Working with the software</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t use the provided databases, then get a PocketQuery from <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/pocket/">geocaching.com</a>.</li>
<li>Import it. (You find the button on the Overview Page)</li>
<li>It is a good Idea to start off the importing of the RouterDb right now. In order to do that, you have to get an OSM pbf file from <a href="download.geofabrik.de">geofabrik.de</a>, and then import it. We’ll return to the purpose of this file.</li>
<li>If you don’t use the provided Databases, you’ll find the Ratingprofiles page empty. Go ahead and give points to what is important to you. If you use the provided Databases you’ll find some presets, feel free to manipulate them. Don’t forget to save!</li>
<li>Now you’re ready to click the rate geocaches button in the map window. Some magic should happen and you see the Geocaches in different color, based on your rating.</li>
<li>By now the importing of the OSM Data should be done, otherwise please be patient.</li>
<li>Go to the Routingprofiles tab now. Again, if you’ve used the provided databases, you’ll find some presets. Feel free to change them.</li>
<li>Now select a startpoint (and an endpoint) from the map by rightclicking anywhere on the map or by writing the coordinates into the appropriate fields. Click ‘Create Route’ and after some moments you should see the perfect route for your next geocaching tour ;)</li>
</ul>
